This project is my graduation project at the University of Manchester. The project is based on a popular product in the toy
market, a slot car. The slot car is developed to operate as an autonomous car through enhancing
the hardware and the software of it. The car gathers data from different sensors to reach an
understanding of the curvature of the track. The data collected is processed and the car becomes
self-driven. The target hardware is ARDUINO NANO 33 BLE (ABX00034).
